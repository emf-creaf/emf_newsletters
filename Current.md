## New datasets in the EMF catalog

  - HydroSHEDS [https://www.hydrosheds.org]: HydroBASINS (watershed boundaries and sub-basin delineations), HydroRIVERS (vectorized line network of all global rivers that have a catchment area of at least 10 km2 or an average river flow of 0.1 cubic meters per second, or both), HydroLAKES (shoreline polygons of all global lakes with a surface area of at least 10 ha).
  - AVAMET [https://www.avamet.org/]: Automatic meteorological station network from the Pais Valencia meteorology association.
  - AdapteCCA [https://escenarios.adaptecca.es]: Tool to visualize and download climate change projections for Spain.
  - PhenoCam [https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/]: Cooperative continental-scale phenological observatory that uses imagery from networked digital cameras to track vegetation phenology in a diverse range of ecosystems across North America and around the World. 
  - GEDI [https://gedi.umd.edu/data/products/]: High-resolution laser ranging of Earth’s forests and topography from the International Space Station.
  - NABBS [https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/bbs/index.cfm]: Cooperative effort between the U.S. Geological Survey's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center and Environment Canada's Canadian Wildlife Service to monitor the status and trends of North American bird populations. 
  - RCP database [https://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at/RcpDb/]: The RCP database aims at documenting the emissions, concentrations, and land-cover change projections of the so-called "Representative Concentration Pathways".
  - PaleoClim [http://www.paleoclim.org/]: High-resolution paleoclimate data for use in biological modeling and GIS.

## New models in the EMF catalog

  - FORCAsT [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4776662]: FORest Canopy Atmosphere Transfer model is a canopy model capable of simulating the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from biogenic VOC oxidation.
  - FORCEEPS [http://capsis.cirad.fr/capsis/help_en/forceeps]: A forest community model for woody species (Angiosperms and Gymnosperms). Inspired by the gap model ForClim, deals with environmental and biotic filtering of forest communities and ecosystem processes such as biomass production.
  - PICUS [https://boku.ac.at/en/wabo/waldbau/research/working-areas/waldoekosystemmodellierung/dynamische-oekosystemmodelle/picus]: The PICUS model family is based on the patch model approach and comprises the three model variants,each operating on a different level of physiological detail.
  - MAIDEN [https://dendro-eco.uqat.ca/maiden/]: MAIDEN is an ecophysiological model that was created to explore the relationships between climate variability and forest growth-productivity. The simulations can be verified using different data to validate the different processes in the model, including dendroecological growth data, 13C and 18O data and measurements of ecosystem carbon and water fluxes.
